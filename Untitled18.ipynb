    "Answer-The difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding lies in their application and the nature of the categorical variables being encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: Involves assigning a numerical value to each category in a categorical variable based on some predefined order or hierarchy. This encoding assumes that there is a meaningful order or ranking among the categories.\n",
    "Example: Consider a variable \"Education Level\" with categories {\"High School\", \"Bachelor's\", \"Master's\", \"PhD\"}. Ordinal encoding might assign values {0, 1, 2, 3} respectively, reflecting the increasing level of education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: Involves assigning a unique numerical value to each category in a categorical variable without assuming any particular order or ranking among the categories.\n",
    "Example: Consider a variable \"Color\" with categories {\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"}. Label encoding might assign values {0, 1, 2} respectively, without implying any order among the colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might choose Ordinal Encoding when there is a clear order or ranking among the categories that you want to capture in the encoding. On the other hand, you would choose Label Encoding when there is no inherent order among the categories, or when the order is not important for the analysis."

    "Answer- Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique where the categories of a categorical variable are ranked based on the target variable's mean or median. It assigns ordinal labels to categories in a way that captures the relationship between the categories and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In a machine learning project for predicting customer churn, we can use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to rank the categories of a feature like \"Education Level\" based on the average churn rate for each category. This would assign higher labels to categories associated with higher churn rates, capturing the trend observed in the data."
